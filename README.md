# EDA-for-child-weight-at-birth-and-gestation-details

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding the relationship between child weight at birth and gestation details. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset to better understand the factors influencing child birth weight.

## Introduction

Birth weight is a critical factor in determining neonatal health. This project explores the relationship between gestation period and birth weight along with other associated variables. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can help understand these key health indicators.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains details about:
- Birth weights (in grams)
- Gestation periods (in weeks)
- The source of the dataset is '/kaggle/input/child-weight-at-birth-and-gestation-details'.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:
- Visualizations to identify trends and relationships among variables.
- Correlation and regression analysis to determine the impact of gestation on birth weight.

## Results

Key insights from the analysis include:
- Most women tend to have babies in their 20s. In our dataset, the mean age is 27.26, the median age is 26, and the mode age is 23, indicating that childbirth is most common in the mid to late twenties.
- Age and gestation are very weakly negatively correlated.
- Motherâ€™s weight and smoking status are strong predictors of birth weight
